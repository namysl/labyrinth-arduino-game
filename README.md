 Find a way and don't step twice on a tile: the goal of this game is to step on each tile just once and reach the marked tile in the end. If you tread on the same square twice, you have to try again from the beginning.

The game is inspired by a ice puzzle from the Pokémon Ruby/Sapphire and it seems that a Hamiltonian path comes in handy while playing games. 

## Arduino:

In this project I used a Thumb Joystick (Iduino ST1079), 128x64 I2C SSD1306 OLED screen, a piezo buzzer, a 1000 Ω restistor and of course Arduino Uno.

## Features:

* There are 5 available levels to choose in the menu
* There is a sound when you win or lose and when you start a level
* The game itself

## To do:

* Exit from a level
* New graphics
